# Cloned Repositories

## Repo 1: [CASTILLO](https://github.com/DanielFPerez/castillo_code)
- **Purpose**: Characterizing Response Length Distributions of Large Language Models.
- **Location**: `code/castillo/`
- **Key content**:
    - Scripts to generate responses from various LLMs.
    - Analysis notebooks for length distributions.
    - Data collection methodology.
- **Notes**: This repository provides the tools to reproduce the CASTILLO dataset, which characterizes how response lengths vary for different models and prompts. It is useful for analyzing the "predictability" of length.
